# ShelfSignals

ShelfSignals is a system-agnostic analytics framework for extracting structure,
patterns, and insights from collection inventories. It is designed for research
libraries, archives, and any environment where catalog metadata and numbering
systems contain implicit signals about provenance, organization, or workflow
history.

ShelfSignals ingests catalog records, normalizes metadata, and uses configurable
analysis modules to detect patterns in numbering sequences, item groupings,
descriptive fields, and other latent structures. The project is entirely
collection-neutral and adaptable to future datasets.

## Features

- **Metadata Harvesting**  
  Connectors for scraping, exporting, or ingesting catalog data (API, CSV,
  HTML/DOM extraction, etc.).

- **Normalization Layer**  
  Standardizes fields, numbering systems, identifiers, and formats across
  heterogeneous sources.

- **Pattern Analysis Engine**  
  Modules for:
  - sequence detection  
  - call number pattern clustering  
  - accession/cutter analysis  
  - temporal or spatial grouping  
  - anomaly detection  

- **Visualization Tools**  
  Heatmaps, sequence plots, cluster maps, and lineage timelines.

- **Export & Reporting**  
  Configurable output formats (CSV, JSON, Markdown reports, visual dashboards).

- **Deep Facets**  
  Probabilistic content detection using AI-powered metadata analysis:
  - **Embedded Photography Likelihood**: Estimates the probability that books contain photographic inserts or plates, even when not categorized as photography books
  - Conservative, metadata-driven scoring using xAI (Grok) API
  - Toggleable visual overlays and filtering in web interfaces

## Goals

ShelfSignals aims to:

1. Reveal hidden organizational structure in collection metadata.  
2. Identify sequential numbering patterns and anomalies.  
3. Provide a reusable toolkit for ongoing research and cross-collection studies.  
4. Support data preparation for external reporting or downstream machine-learning tasks.

## Web Interfaces

ShelfSignals provides two web interfaces for exploring the Sekula Library collection:

### Production Site (`/`)
- **Location**: `docs/index.html`
- **Data Source**: `docs/data/sekula_inventory.json` (CSV-compatible format)
- **Status**: ⚠️ **Deprecated** - Known performance issues and freezing. Please use Preview v2.x
- **Access URL**: https://evcatalyst.github.io/ShelfSignals/
- **Direct link**: [Production Site](https://evcatalyst.github.io/ShelfSignals/)

⚠️ **Note**: This v1.x interface has known performance issues. Users are redirected to the Preview v2.x environment for the best experience.

### Preview Environment (`/preview/`)
- **Location**: `docs/preview/index.html`
- **Data Source**: `docs/data/sekula_index.json` (JSON-native format from Primo API)
- **Status**: Experimental, modular architecture
- **Access URL**: https://evcatalyst.github.io/ShelfSignals/preview/
- **Direct link**: [Preview Environment](https://evcatalyst.github.io/ShelfSignals/preview/)

The preview environment showcases a modernized, modular architecture with:
- **Modular JavaScript utilities** in `docs/js/`:
  - `signals.js` - Centralized signals (theme) registry and keyword matching
  - `lc.js` - LC call-number parser extracting class, number, and sorting keys
  - `colors.js` - Unified color logic with colorblind-friendly palettes and localStorage persistence
  - `search.js` - Debounced search state with match computation across multiple fields
  - `year.js` - Year normalization utility for messy date strings
- **Enhanced features**:
  - JSON-based data loading from Primo API harvests
  - Improved accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, focus management)
  - Search highlighting and explicit empty states
  - Enhanced detail panel with LC ranges, signal counts, and catalog links
  - Color palette selector with accessibility options
  - Real-time search with match counts and field-level feedback

The preview environment serves as a testing ground for new features before they are promoted to production.

## Thematic Alignment

ShelfSignals is purpose-built to reveal the **implicit structure** embedded within library collections. Rather than treating catalogs as flat databases, it recognizes that:

- **Numbering systems encode organization**: Call numbers, accession numbers, and shelf locations reflect historical decisions about classification and proximity.
- **Subjects reveal themes**: Subject headings and notes contain rich semantic signals about content, provenance, and research focus.
- **Patterns emerge at scale**: Clustering, sequence analysis, and visual representation make latent structures visible.

The Allan Sekula Library serves as the prototype collection because its thematic focus—photography, labor, maritime culture, critical theory—creates distinct signals that can be detected, visualized, and analyzed. This approach is **collection-neutral** and can be adapted to any catalog with structured metadata.

### Core Principles

1. **System-agnostic ingestion**: Works with any metadata source (APIs, CSV, HTML scraping)
2. **Normalization layer**: Standardizes heterogeneous field formats and vocabularies
3. **Configurable analysis**: Modular pattern detection adaptable to different collections
4. **Visual intelligence**: Transforms metadata into spatial, chromatic, and interactive representations
5. **Research-oriented**: Designed for discovery and insight, not end-user search

## Version History & Roadmap

### Current Versions

- **Production (v1.x)**: Stable interface with proven workflows and CSV-based data loading
- **Preview (v2.x)**: Experimental modular architecture with enhanced accessibility and JSON-native data

### Migration Path

Features proven in the preview environment will be selectively promoted to production. The modular JavaScript utilities (`signals.js`, `lc.js`, `colors.js`, `search.js`, `year.js`) represent reusable components that can be integrated into future analysis tools beyond the web interface.

## Deep Facets

ShelfSignals includes **Deep Facets**: AI-powered probabilistic content detection that reveals latent patterns in collections beyond traditional cataloging.

### Embedded Photography Likelihood

A probabilistic facet that estimates the likelihood (0–100) that books contain actual photographic inserts or plates, even when not categorized as photography books.

**Key Features**:
- **Conservative scoring**: High scores (>70) require converging signals from multiple metadata fields
- **Token-efficient**: Compact feature packets extracted from metadata
- **Stable & deterministic**: Consistent scores across runs for the same prompt version
- **Automated pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow for collection-wide scoring
- **Visual integration**: Toggleable overlay with color-coded likelihood tints

**Documentation**: See [docs/PHOTO_LIKELIHOOD_FACET.md](docs/PHOTO_LIKELIHOOD_FACET.md) for full implementation details.

**Try it**:
- [Production interface](https://evcatalyst.github.io/ShelfSignals/) - Toggle "📷 Embedded Photography" in header controls
- [Preview interface](https://evcatalyst.github.io/ShelfSignals/preview/) - Same feature with enhanced accessibility
